     message: string, 
     status: number,
     headers: Headers,
     requestId: string,
     correlationId: string,
     timestamp: number
   }
   ```
3. **Update type definitions**: If using custom type definitions, ensure compatibility with new generic constraints
4. **Review logging**: Enhanced logging may provide more detailed information in your logs
